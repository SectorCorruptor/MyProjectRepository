# MyProjectRepository
This is a Repository where all my projects go.

To be more specific, I program Python projects, if the time comes,
I'll add their source code here.

All my Python projects are on pypi. In case you want them,
you can open your terminal, then enter:

    py -m pip install MyModuleName
          
where MyModuleName is a module I made.

I've made strfilter.py and boxmaker.py till now. Don't worry, there will be more
Python projects when uploaded.
